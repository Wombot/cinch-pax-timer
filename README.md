# Cinch::Plugins::PaxTimer

Cinch Plugin to track the time till PAX.

I will eventually try to expand this into an event agnostic EventTimer
plugin, but issues with how cince scopes config values with plugins are
slowing down that effort.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'cinch-pax-timer'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cinch-pax-timer

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
